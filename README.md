## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed and downloaded:

1.  **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Version **22** is required.
2.  **PostgreSQL:** A running instance of the PostgreSQL database server.
3.  **PostgreSQL JDBC Driver:** Download the `.jar` file from the [official PostgreSQL website](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/download/).
4.  **JavaFX SDK:** Download the SDK **(21.0.7)** for your operating system and Java version from [GluonHQ](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/).

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup Guide

This project requires a PostgreSQL database. The following instructions use `psql`, the standard command-line interface for PostgreSQL.

### Step 1: Create the Database

First, connect to your PostgreSQL server and create a new, empty database for the project.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE mvaahan;
````

### Step 2: Build the Database Schema

Next, execute the `schema.sql` script. This file contains all the `CREATE TABLE` statements, functions, and triggers required to build the database structure from scratch.

```sh
# Navigate to your project directory in the terminal
psql -U your_postgres_username -d mvaahan -f db/schema.sql
```

### Step 3: Seed the Database with Initial Data

Finally, run the `seeds.sql` script. This will populate your new database with essential data, such as vehicle categories, exam questions, and a default officer account for testing purposes.

```sh
# Make sure you are still in your project directory
psql -U your_postgres_username -d mvaahan -f db/seeds.sql
```

Your database is now fully configured and ready to connect to the application.

## üöÄ How to Run the Project

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Mitesh0101/mVaahan.git
cd mVaahan
```

### Step 2: Open in your Java IDE
Import the project as a new project in your preferred IDE, such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

### Step 3: Configure Project Libraries (Crucial Step)
You must add the downloaded JavaFX and PostgreSQL JARs to your project's build path.
**In IntelliJ IDEA:**
-   Go to **File** -> **Project Structure...** (`Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S`).
-   Select **Libraries** from the left panel.
-   Click the **+** (Add) button and select **Java**.
-   Navigate to and select the **PostgreSQL JDBC driver `.jar` file** you downloaded.
-   Click **+** again, select **Java**, and navigate to the `lib` folder inside the **JavaFX SDK** you downloaded. Select all the `.jar` files.
-   Click **Apply** and then **OK**.

### Step 4: Configure Source & Resource Folders (Crucial Step)
To avoid a "Location is required" exception when loading FXML files, you must mark the resources directory as a Resource Root.

In IntelliJ IDEA:
- Go to File -> Project Structure... (or press Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S).
- Select Modules from the left panel.
- Expand your project structure in the center panel and find the src/main/resources folder.
- Select the resources folder and click the Resources button from the menu above the file tree.
- The folder icon should change color, indicating it's now a resource root.
- Click Apply and then OK.

This step ensures that the FXML files are correctly placed on the classpath and can be found by your application at runtime.

### Step 5: Configure VM Options
```sh
--module-path /path/to/javafx/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml
```

### Step 6: Configure the Database Connection
Locate the database configuration file in your project (e.g., `db.properties`, `config.java`). Update the JDBC connection string and credentials to match your PostgreSQL setup.

**Important:** Ensure you are using the correct JDBC URL for PostgreSQL.

```properties
db.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mvaahan
db.username=your_postgres_username
db.password=your_postgres_password
```

### Step 7: Build and Run
Build the project to resolve all dependencies and then run the Main.java file from your IDE.
Test Officer data : Username : VikramSinghRTO, Password : password123
